Practice task. Creating of a class which extendes any collections classes or interfaces.

The class must contain some methods. They are described down.
1. Methods *add(int index, Integer value)* and *add(Integer value)* adds *value* to the collection by index *index* or 
to the end of the collection. All elements of the collections increase by *value*.
2. Methods *removeForIndex(int index)* and *remove(Integer value)* remove an element by index *index* or a value *value*
if the collection has this value. All elements of the collecntion decrease by value of the element by index *index* or *value*.
3. Methods *searchValues(int value)* and *searchIndex(int index)* search an element by index *index* of value *value*. They
return found element.
4. Methods *maxVal()*, *minVal()* and *averageVal()* return maximum, minimum or average value of the collection appropriately.
